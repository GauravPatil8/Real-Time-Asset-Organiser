To create a preset of folder structure, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Example Folder Structure**: First, create an example folder structure setup on your device.<br>

2. **Enter Main Folder Path**: In the addon UI, enter the path of the main folder or simply select it from the file browser that appears after clicking on the button with the folder icon.

3. **Analyze Folder Structure**: The addon will then analyze the folder structure and present its name along with a list of tags that you can give to the subdirectories.<br>

4. **Assign Tags to Subdirectories**: The tag that you add to the subdirectory will be used to store that type of asset in the specified subfolder. If you don't want to add any asset in that folder, you can set the tag to "none".<br>
