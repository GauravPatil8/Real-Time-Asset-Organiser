1. **On Click**: 
   When the `On Click` option is selected, you will have to click the button after an asset has been downloaded to organize it in the destination folder.

2. **Real-time**: 
   When the `Real-time` option is set, you can click `Start` to begin real-time monitoring for downloaded assets, and the assets will be automatically arranged in their destination folder.

   You can set a delay time after which the addon will look for downloaded assets and organize them. There are three delay times available:
   - 1 Second
