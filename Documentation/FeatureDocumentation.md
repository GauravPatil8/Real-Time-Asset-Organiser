# Addon Features

## Selecting a Preset

In this option, you can select the folder structure preset or use the Default folder structure. There are four buttons provided below for installation, deletion, refreshing the list, or sharing the preset.

### Installing a Preset
If you want to install a folder structure preset created by someone (friend or colleague), you need to first download it from them and store it on your computer. Then, you can click on the "Install" button in the UI panel of the addon. It will open up a file browser from where you can choose the directory where you have stored the preset (usually a '.json' file). Just select the preset and click "Install Preset". This will install the preset in the addon.

:::note
After installing the preset, you will have to restart Blender.

### Deleting a Preset
To delete a preset, simply select the preset you want to remove from the list and click the "Remove" Button. This action will uninstall the preset permanently.

### Refresh
This button refreshes and displays the list of all presets available.

### Share Preset
Clicking this button will open up a file browser for you to choose a location to store the preset on your system. From there, you can share the preset with anyone through email or other means.
