    a. **Installing a Preset:**
    
        If you want to install a folder structure preset created by someone (friend or colleague), you need to first download it from them and store it on your computer. Then you can click on the install button in the UI panel of the addon. It will open up a file browser from where you can choose the directory where you have stored the preset (usually a '.json' file). Then just select the preset and click install preset. This will install the preset in the addon.
        
        > **Note:** After installing the preset, you will have to restart Blender.

    b. **Deleting a Preset:**
    
        Just select the preset which you want to delete from the list and click the Remove Button. This will uninstall the preset permanently.

    c. **Refresh:**
    
        This button refreshes and displays the list of all presets available.

    d. **Share Preset:**
    
        Clicking this button will open up a file browser for you to choose a location to store the preset on your system. From there, you can share the preset with anyone through email or other ways.
